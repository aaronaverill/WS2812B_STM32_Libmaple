/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Arduino library to control WS2812B RGB Led strips using the Arduino STM32 LibMaple core
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  Note. 
  This library has only been tested on the WS2812B LED. It may not work with the older WS2812 or
  other types of addressable RGB LED, becuase it relies on a division multiple of the 72Mhz clock 
  frequence on the STM32 SPI to generate the correct width T0H pulse, of 400ns +/- 150nS
  SPI DIV32 gives a pulse width of 444nS which is well within spec for the WS2812B but
  is probably too long for the WS2812 which needs a 350ns pulse for T0H
